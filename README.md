    Documentation solution for frontend developers.

## Motivation

    While I was working on my documentation site in 2019 I realised that documenting components are very time consuming and not all of my collegues would be able to document their own work unless they have to physically go into the code and make some changes.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## Installation

   To get started simply do the following:
 ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/SepStacks/DEVnIT.git
   cd devnit
   npm install
   
   # serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
   npm run dev
 ```

=======
    I came to the conclusion that the best method to approach this issue was to create a solution that enables the user to generate markdown files within a UI. my first attempt was with vuepress, although pretty powerful. it lacked alot of features I needed eg. a dynamic sidebar, I did however manage to create my own using node but it had some bugs so I was stuck abit and had to work on some other projects.

    When I saw nuxt came out with an awesome update called nuxt@content, I was very existed since I'm already using nuxt in my day to day job and this new feature has alot of potenial so I set on a mission to create a solution for my previous issue.


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
