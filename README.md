    Documentation solution for frontend developers.

## Motivation

While I was working on my documentation site in 2019 I realised that documenting components are very time consuming and not all of my collegues would be able to
document their own work unless they have to physically go into the code and make some changes.

I came to the conclusion that the best method to approach this issue was to create a solution that enables the user to generate markdown files within a UI.
my first attempt was with vuepress, although pretty powerful. it lacked alot of features I needed eg. a dynamic sidebar, I did however manage to create my own using node
but it had some bugs so I was stuck abit and had to work on some other projects.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Credits
