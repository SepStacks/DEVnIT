# textfield-prop

> This component was based on the textfield-prop component of the style guide, well have to link it to the main style guide project if this component was seperate but if we want to have it as a nested component we can work out a process for that aswell


## Usage



<!-- Component template need to be here -->

<doc-component :file="'STYLEGUIDE/textfield-prop/STYLEGUIDE_textfield-prop-usage'" :name="'textfield-prop'"></doc-component >
